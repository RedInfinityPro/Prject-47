## 📖 Description
The code snippet demonstrates using a pygame library to create UI panels for business entries, including a Rocket Content class with a manager, scroll container, name, key, cost, fuel usage, distance, upkeep, and storage. The panel is built using a weighted random distribution and a UIButton. The panel is updated with the Rocket Upgrade class, Rocket Content class, and RocketUpgrade class. The code also creates a planet store and planet content using a pygame library and a planet_name_gen import. The game is divided into three panels: TopPanel, DetailsPanel, and BottomPanel. The code generates a business name using a random.choice function, which generates a name with various patterns.
